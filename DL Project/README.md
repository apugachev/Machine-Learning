## Deep Learning Project

As a part of "Deep Learning" course project we should reproduce the results of paper [How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11604.pdf). 

The four Jupyter notebooks provided at this moment reconstitute experiments from pictures 1 and 2 from the paper.
